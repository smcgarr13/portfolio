            <p> From the first time I picked up a hammer in my next-door neighbor’s workshop, I knew I loved creating things
                    from a pile of “stuff”. I was 5 years old and there was no greater satisfaction than using my wobbly table
                    to host a tea party with my mom; Brian, my first baby doll; and my stuffed monkey. I’m not sure what happened
                    to that table, but I’ll never forget the passion that was ignited the day I created it.

                    Come High School, I opted for electives like Drafting & Architecture, in which I won the Industrial Arts
                    Award in a competition with college students; Automotive Repair; and Photography. It was clear – I loved
                    working with my hands, found comfort in a good challenge, thrived on solving problems, and needed a
                    creative outlet.  So here I am, many moons later, a seasoned product designer and future web developer!
